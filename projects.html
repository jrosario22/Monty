            <h1>NYC Math Scores Data</h1>
            <p> This project looked at New York City Math exam scores of students with and without disabilities from 2006 - 2012. Using statistical inferences and R, I was able to analyze the data to answer questions such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do students with disabilties struggle more with math compared to students who do not have a disability?</li>
                <li>Do students who succeed in math continue to do so as they progress?</li>
                <li>Are scores consistent throughout the grade levels?</li>
                <li>Are scores consistent throughtout the year?</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Set Game</h1>
            <p>The Set game is a math card game. Three cards make up a "set", which a player collects by making sure each of those three cards has exactly the same matching feature or else all have a different feature. If two cards match in one of the four features, but the third card does not, then the three cards are not a "set" and the player is penalized instead of being able to collect. Made with Xcode in Swift.</p>
